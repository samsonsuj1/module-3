        <h3>eHA Academy in Summary</h3>
        <p>
            eHA Academy offers a comprehensive curriculum covering everything from HTML and CSS to advanced JavaScript frameworks. <br>The structured approach and supportive community made it the perfect choice for me. When I first logged into the eHA Academy platform, I was greeted with a user-friendly interface and a wealth of resources. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as I prepared to dive into my first lesson.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The online platform is designed for ease of use, featuring interactive coding exercises and video tutorials. The community forums are bustling with activity, allowing students to ask questions and share insights.

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>The following are Projects I have worked on during the cause of my journey:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recipe Book</li>
            <li>Travel Webpage</li>
            <li>My Blog</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It was challenging to integrate everything I had learned, but seeing it come together was incredibly rewarding. I faced issues with responsive design, but after some trial and error, I figured it out!</p>
