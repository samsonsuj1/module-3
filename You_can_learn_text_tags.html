        <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        <em>There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10</em>.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk</em>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <em>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger</em>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        <strong>It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet</strong>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are</strong>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
